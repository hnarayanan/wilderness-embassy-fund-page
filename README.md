This is the source for a simple landing page for the [Wilderness Embassy](http://wildernessembassy.com/) funding campaign.

The Wilderness Embassy is a website (in Norwegian/English) which aims to help children learn more about the relationship between humans, animals and our planet by promoting creative outdoor activities.

If you're interested in this sort of thing, please consider [supporting the project](http://foend.no/Project/995c7965-79e8-499a-a4fa-c0cdd2374e30).
